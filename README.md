# Realtime-Tracking-based-on-Color
This code captures video from a webcam, applies HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) filtering, and displays the processed video in real-time using OpenCV. Trackbars are created to adjust HSV thresholds dynamically, allowing the user to fine-tune the filtering. The code converts each frame to HSV, applies the HSV range mask, and then performs Gaussian and median blurring on the selected regions. Contours are found and drawn on a blank image, which is also blurred and dilated for better visualization. Multiple windows display the original frame, the masked selection, the dilated frame, and the contours. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
